# Sitecore Docker HTTPS example using Traefik v2

Demonstrates how to configure a reverse proxy ([Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik/) in this case) to handle SSL with a auto generated self-signed certificate on the frontend and proxy traffic to backend services using HTTP.

## Usage

1. Add (or edit) environment variables used so they match what Windows build your are running and which registry you are using. See [the .env file](.env).
1. Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert), open a terminal in the /traefik folder and execute `mkcert "*.sitecore-https.local"`
1. Add `solr.sitecore-https.local` and `cm.sitecore-https.local` to your HOSTS file.
1. Run `docker-compose up --build`

> IMPORTANT: The traefik service in docker-compose.yml is configured to use port 80 and 443, so if you got anything running using the same ports for example IIS, you need to shut it down (or stop the sites) or change the ports.

## Notes

1. Custom `traefik` image is needed due to an error in traefik that requires containers to run in process isolation mode but official traefik images is not supplied for Windows 1903 and 1909.
    1. This issue may be resolved in traefik v2 but there is *another* [issue](https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues/5968) with that official images that keeps the container from starting :)
